This repo is a collection of systems biology content that I've
gathered, written, or programmed in an effort to learn more about how
[TBCK](https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/tbck-syndrome) works
and what tools I have to help Fern.

I have a very specific brain and this repo is an artifact of me trying
to use it to help my daughter.

# Contents

* [**power-violence**](./power-violence): Here I make a Racket---e.g., I'm
  trying to learn Racket so I can use

* [**mediKanren**](./mediKanren): This is a minikanren clone that uses
  minikanren's brand of proof search to find paths through the network
  of protein and gene regulation.
  
  Specifically, it's a submodule of my own fork of mediKanren, where I
  intend to ask it things about TBCK just as soon as I know enough
  Racket to be dangerous.

* [**alon-sys-bio**](./alon-sys-bio): Lecture notes from [Uri
  Alon's Systems Biology
  course](https://vid.puffyan.us/playlist?list=PLLbr-B8cNbo6v4kc68JowzUeAYdh6gdQH),
  recorded in 2018.
